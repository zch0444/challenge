variable:
N: the desired # of products
n: the total # of products
money: desired dollar amount
data: JSON objects of products sorted by price
      the data is in inputfile.txt, which is got from http://api.zappos.com/Search?term=boots&sort={"price":"asc"}&limit=100&page=80&callback=&key=YOUR_API_KEY

algorithm:
First get the upper bound using greedy algorithm. If the upper bound is less than desired dollar amount 
or no way to be less than desire dollar amount, the answer is obvious last or first N products.
Then using knapsack algorithm with constraint of number of products to get one answer.
